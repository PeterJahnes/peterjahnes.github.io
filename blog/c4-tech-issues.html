				<p>A cool twist on the presidential phrase. Well, all politics aside, this is a very serious issue for the future of our world.  I was born in 1981, my life cycle has pretty much followed the path of the personal computing age. When I was a baby so were PCs. I was fortunate enough to go to very good schools where we had a great computer lab. My lower school and middle school, the same school, actually got a .edu TLD, they only give those to universities now. I am very computer savvy, and started to get into coding when I was very young, all be it simple coding. At the same time, most of the official computer classes we were assigned to play games like Simcity for social studies. It hardly seemed designed to get me into a career in computers, but at the same time nobody at that time could fathom how far computers would permeate our daily lives. Today it feels like most education has the same outlook on computers, they use them for education but do not educates about them. How is it that attitudes have not changed in over twenty years in the face of the blatantly obvious advance of technology? I feel it is quite obvious that when I am 80 I will be served at restaurants by a robot and I will be controlling my electronic devices with my brain to order that Cuban sandwich. I feel that these things will happen, its just a matter of if its only for the rich people or not. The sole way to bring this society to a better place, is through education. Teach people how to use the tools to educate themselves and amazing things will happen. Before I started learning as a kid, I had to learn how to use a book, open it, turn the page, find the page I was on, look things up in the golsery. Now a days, you don't have to be lucky enough to have a great liberary near you, the world of information comes to you if you can use it. </p>
				<p>By the way when I am talking about computers, I mean that generically, to me a phone and a nest are computers just as much as the gigantic desktop that I am writing this on is. In the next 30 years the next generations of children will be living in a world where technology has advanced so far that more then half of the jobs will be in technology. If we don't start including coding class, as well as other technology classes, to all schools all over the world and start encouraging children to go into STEM careers, yes STEM not just technology, the world will not be able to reach its full potential. Today our children learn what is inside the human body, but they don't learn what is inside anything else, a little ironically self centered if you think about it lol. What about whats inside that cellphone, or how does one of those amazing new refrigerators work? You know, the ones with wifi that tell you when you are low on beer. How does it know I need more ice cream and can I make it turn on a siren instead of a push message to a shopping list? I feel it would be more appropriate.</p>
				<p>Anyways enough talking about the problem, how do we fix it? Well, it wont be easy. We have a systemic problem in our society that has been largely brought on by technology, that is instant gratification. Our teachers and schools are horribly underfunded. I say that this is caused by instant gratification because most people can not see 30 years into the future, never mind care about it now. It is exceedingly difficult for humans, especially todays, to grasp how much good something will do if the result wont be seen for another 20 or 30 years. I don't have the answers on how to get from A to Z but hopefully I can help the collective you find the right path.</p>
