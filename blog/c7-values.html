				<p>Creativity I feel is the most important part of human life. Having a child like wonder about things and a true curiosity about every thing is the best part of life. I am constantly inspired by others works from building a windmill to building a company. I feel that this drives the brain to excessive and be healthy and generally elevates society to an immeasurable degree. I try to think of new things and gather inspiration every day.</p>

				<p>I feel that my values are such that I do not pay attention to stereo types and it can be a hindrance in recognizing when the threat is there. As I have learned about this more through DCB I feel that I will be more aware of it when I do experience it in my life.</p>
				<p>There are many ways to kick yourself when you are down. I feel that in this intense environment where there is pressure to take advantage of the opportunity, you are limited to what you can do by human psychology. If you check out or take a break you will feel even more down that you are not keeping up. The best way to get out of it is switch up what you are doing to something wholly different but still constructive towards your final goal. There is so much that is involved in the career that we will be going into after this that you have a large selection of things to focus on. Give your self a few small wins and you will find that the snowball will roll naturally, bring you back up. Happy coding!</p>
