				<p>Peer pairing coding sessions are an integral part of learning at DBC. This is where 2 two students get together online and use google hangouts and or stype to work on a coding challenge together.  This is an awesome way to work on coding challanges. It helps you think through a problem and learn cool tricks from your pair. One person is a driver, by that I mean that they are doing the typing following the instructions from thier pair. The other person is a navigator, they will guide the driver through to code and follow the instructions given. I have learned a lot of very cool tricks in sublime with ruby while pairing. I have some experience with building websites and so in the early sessions I was doing a lot of teaching which was very rewarding. I think the only frustrating thing about pairing is the stability of technology, apps crash and life gets interesting. 
				</p>
				<p>Feedback at DBC is a very important part of the program. When I first realized that I had feedback, I had already gotten a few in. If felt good hearing honest feedback from kind people. I know that I am human and know all too well that I need to improve. Getting this kind, actionable, and specific feedback is amazingly refreshing, especially after coming back from china where the only feedback I got for 2 years was a smile and a nod. The funny thing with the feedback that I have gotten has felt deserved, or maybe even expected. I always analyse interactions afterwards to see if there are any areas that I can improve on and invariably I come up with one or two. The funny thing is that the feedback that I have received has closely matched my own findings. If it didnâ€™t then it has always made sence with me and I feel that they are correct. </p>
				<p>Writing feedback is very difficult for me. I am a nice person, some say too nice. This makes it difficult for me to criticize others, even in a constructive way. Not because I dont want to hurt them, but because I am scared of saying it in a way that will hurt them. I think that my saving grace has been having to rate others feedback. I feel that reading these is an awesome way for me to build guide for myself to write better feedback. I try and incorporate the things that I see and like. </p>
				<p>All in all, this program of pairing and feedback has been very beneficial for me and is a well thought out system for helping focusing learning not only a subject but also on working in the coding environment. This I argue is just as important as learning Ruby or html, because without it, it will be much more difficult to hold a job and be happy in the coding workplace. I strongly recommend pair coding for anything not just learning as it is a much more relaxed way to think things out and make sure you have everything right.</p>
