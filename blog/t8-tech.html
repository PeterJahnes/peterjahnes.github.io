				<p>There are many more computers in this world than you might think. Everything from an Ipod to that VCR you have in the closet is just as much a computer as the actual computer or smart phone (yes even those) you are reading this on now. Most people don't think about this in their daily lives, we take them for granted. If you break down what a computer is, you can start to understand just how important they are to your life and the future of our world. </p>
				<p>The simplest of simple …</p>
				<p>A computer has data that it can do things with.</p>
				<p>To make it useful however, it will also have ways to take in and output data. If it couldn't do this there would be no point for its existence, aside from art maybe? Your Ipod takes in data, wait, what? You have to put the songs, thats data, and so are the buttons you press to change the song and pause and … </p>
				<p>A little more fundamentally a computer has memory and a processor. The memory is a place to store information. You may know that there are more then one types of memory that you hear about when you buy electronics. They are all basically the same thing. They store ones and zeros. The main difference that determines its use is how fast it is. Generally the faster it is the more expensive it is. In the past and even now this meant that you had the prioritize your memory needs to keep costs down. This is slowly starting to change with technology advances and soon you will only need one type of memory for everything. In the mean time, what you need to know is that the more RAM or Memory a device has the faster it will run and the more it can do at 1 time. (yes even your smart phone is doing more then one thing at a time). The more storage space it had the more songs, movie, pictures, and any other stuff you have.</p>
				<p>The processor is the brain of the computer if you think of a brain with no memory. It may seem that computers are smart, but actually they are really stupid. The only thing that makes them smart is that a human told it what to do. The processor takes data from the memory and inputs then follows the instructions. This could be as simple as add 1+4 or as complicated as creating a beautiful 3-D environment. Processors are not like memory, It is difficult to tell how fast it is from the specs that it has. For example, my 10 year old computer had a higher processor speed then my Nexus 5 but the Nexus 5 is faster, by a lot! </p>
				<p>I plan on continuing this subject in the future and in great detail. If you would like to learn how to work the devices in your life better, learn how to use computers and technology, learn how to trouble shoot, or even learn about more advanced computing, I will try to help you with that. I hope this helped! Cheers! </p>
