				<p>I had a tie when I took the thinking style test. I am Concrete Random and Abstract random. From the website below, There are several things that jump out at me especially from the Concrete Random side. First off, Experimenting and Intuition are two ways that I really learn best. I have found that when in a pair I can let this excel to even greater extent. Formal reports and keeping detailed records have always been a struggle for me. The fact that I am having to write things down I feel is helping a ton even though I struggle at it a lot.
				</p> 
				<p>Up to this point in phase 0 I have struggled to get into the swing of things because of various external factors. For the most part the instructions for the challenges are helping me understand things super easily and have given me a lot of confidence. There have been a few concepts that I have really had trouble with. I just couldn't wrap my head around them.  I am not sure if this is due to my per-conceived notions inhibiting me or it has to be explained in the right way. I have found that if I don't understand something, I keep looking for different explanations and redo things, I can finally understand concepts once I have taken all of the things into consideration.
				</p>
				<p>I guess this is all part of being in, what I hope is, a growth mind set. When I don't understand something, it will bug me until I figure it out. I feel that the growth mindset is really about being curious about everything and accepting that nothing you know is 100% right, I mean, there arn't 9 planets anymore. I mentioned before about my per-conceived ideas of how things worked. I had this old-school idea about how things worked and couldn't work because I have worked with computers for two and a half decades. I am having to adjust by opening my mind to way more far out possibilities then my old dreams have. I find this amusing and humbling at the same time.

				<p>P.S. This was really hard to write.
