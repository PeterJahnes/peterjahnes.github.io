				<p>Conflicts can be a great learning experience and if handled correctly can lead to better understanding. I was Chief Technical Officer at a real estate agency and, naturally, in charge of user accounts. There was an agent whom had his account shutdown for seriously violating company policy. I was told to not turn it back on until the issue was resolved. This gentleman and I had several common friends and so we socialized outside of work on many occasions. I knew that he was hot headed and approached him in sensitive situations with that at the forefront of my mind. He though that I would do him favor and turn his account back of before it was resolved. While I felt for the guy, and tried to be the good cop and show empathy, I knew better and wouldn't budge even after he lost his temper. Then he totally lost his temper and said many very hurtful things that I'm sure he didn't mean. The whole office was watching and shaking their heads, while I just stood there and was polite while he was shouting every combination of bad words at me. At that point, there was nothing I could do to resolve the conflict, so I walked away. </p>
				<p>After a couple of hours the agent came into my office and showed me that he had finished what was needed to get his account turned back on. Now, I am a very forgiving person. I will brush off most of what is said to me. However, this time I felt that he needed to apologize for just how nasty he had been to me. He however still felt offended by the fact that I “wasn't his friend” and refused. I then had to refer him to the CEO for the 10th time that day, and stepped back.</p>
				<p>Throughout the following several months, we continued to work in the same office and hang out with the same friends. He just wouldn't speak to me. About once a week I would make a piece offering to him and it would be rejected outright, but with less and less disdain as time went on. Finally one random day he came into my office and flat out apologized. I was very surprised to say the least. We then went and grabbed a beer next door in the bar.</p>
				<p>To this day this childish episode had baffled me. I will never be able to full understand why somebody can be so meanly stubborn. I wish I could go back and say I should have done foo or bar differently but I can't find any significant things that would have helped. The issue was the fact that it all escalated so fast, there was noting I could do. Its like trying to stop an F1 car by holding onto a rope tied to the back, its impossible. I think the only thing that I could have done better or differently in that situation would have been to try to intervene when I first heard about it. I could have then calmed both parties down and brought the conversation back to a sane, constructive footing. Hind sight is 20/20. </p>
