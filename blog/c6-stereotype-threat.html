				<p>Stereotype threat is an interesting subject. I have heard a lot about it indirectly in studies and on  BBC World Service. I don't remember that is was ever referred to by this name or title. It is something that I am very aware of and realized existed even in my sheltered youth. This subject is usually very saddening to me to discuss. Not only because the fact that it exist, but also because when it is discussed ugliness is exposed. My experiences with the discussion that have dealt with this or stereotypes in general is, sadly, very bad. I have found that true empathy is very hard to come by in this world. Being a white, blonde hair, blue eye male, I am constantly told that I can't possibly fathom what is prejudice is, when in reality, every time I hear about it happening I have to fight the urge to cry. Ironically, in a way I feel that that is where I have felt stereotype threat.</p>
				<p>When I experience a situation like this it is always difficult to identify what exactly can be done because every situation is very different. One general thing that can be done is what we saw in the studies that Claude Steele. Identify the threat and then attempt to neutralize it but using a different approach. It could be in the way a new project is presented or the diverted focus in a meeting. Creating and asking for meaningful feedback specifically is very difficult for me. I try to make it organic in the conversation because I feel that what you get is more genuine.</p>
				<p>I feel that making an environment more welcoming is a complex task that deserves way more attention then this post. My main start off point it to just be relaxed and treat everybody with respect. Another thing that I have found very helpful is to look up to the people that you interact with. By this I mean give weight to their value, contribution, accomplishments, and thoughts. Have empathy for the situation and realize the magnitude of events and ideas, not through your eyes, but through others' eyes. Through out high school and my adult life, I have always been a teacher and a tutor. I have found that by doing these things while I am teaching, the brain blocks go a way and understanding blossoms. There is a lot more to it then all of this, I feel that this is a completely inadequate amount of time spent on this subject, so If you are reading this, research more.</p>
