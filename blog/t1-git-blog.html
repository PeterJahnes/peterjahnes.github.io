				<p>Preface:</p>
				<p>I know enough to do damage, and damage is what I did to myself this week. I have been learning to code for a little while now and can build simple sites and apps on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). That being said I ran into a road block and went around it. I wound up waisting my time completing through challange 8 without the actual challanges, just through the phase 0 hand book. The road block that I ran into was I did not have permission on Github to access what I needed. Two lessons relearned:</p>

				<p>stop, breath, and ask "Is your computer plugged into the wall?".</p> 

				<p>There is always an easier way.</p>

				<p>Version control is an absolute MUST! If you look at any technological product, you will see version control. The newest model of Porsche 911 is not called that internally, they call it the 991. The car that they started selling in 1963 is the 911. They stopped selling that model in 1989. Since then they have made several newer versions after that but the 911 stuck because that's what the public fell in love with. I'm sure the 211 was not perfect, so they scrapped that one and moved on. If you look at the other Porsche of the 70s and 80s they were called the 904, 944, 969, ect. Now a days they come up with names instead of numbers because of the influence of science of selling. Also, if you look at the about window in almost any software you will see a version number ( most software go to the “help” menu and select “about”, if there are no menus try pressing the alt or option key). I can guarantee you that there were several versions before that one that were buggy or didn’t work.</p>

				<p>Version control allows you to track changes. Not only that but it allows you to make changes without fear of breaking things. If you do break something, or even everything like I have, then you can just revert back to older versions.  Having worked in the tech industry and being a project manager for development, I have seen the consequences of not using version control. Things break and don't get fixed for 36 hours meanwhile you have 125 employes who CAN'T work.</p>

				<p>Git is software that is designed to allow you to easily implement version control. This will allow you to make changes to working code and test them. You create what is known as a Branch of  the Master, the master being the current working code. Once the changes have past the test, you can then merge them back into the master. I have used version control in my “software development” but it was usually copy and paste to a new folder. Git is waaaaaay better as it allows for much more fine grain control of your version-ing.</p>

				<p>Github is a place to store your repositories, i.e. software. That is seemingly its main function, but its not. Github is a social network in a way. It allows people to work on projects together easily. Even if you do not want to do an open source project or are coding on your own and don't want your code to be public, its still a good idea. You can use it as a resume or have quick access to your code if you are in an interview or trying to help someone. Conversely if you need help, it is very easy to share your code so that you can get help easily.</p>
