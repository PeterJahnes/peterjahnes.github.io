				<p>I have not gotten much experience asking questions online. I have done a ton of studying online, and their for seen a lot of bad questions on my various quests to find the good answers. Another thing that I have, maybe too much, experience in is trouble shooting. The most dificult thing about working in the IT industry for a non IT company is translation. How do I translate this technical thing into something completely non technical. </p>
				<p>I would be walking through the office and someone would pipe up, “Hey Peter! The Internet is broken! Can you fix it?”. Great question, to which the answer is yes. However, more often then not and to my disappointment, I would not be needed to save the world. But a lass, I can help this agent fix their email settings that they messed up while trying to find that picture of their cat to add to an email. Thats it, and in the mean time I had to ask a series of questions to get from my high hopes of saving the world to the lowly task of picking through settings to see what they had broke.</p>
				<p>That series of questions to get from a to b can either be painful or funny. I have found that when it is funny, I get to the bottom of things much faster. Being that I knew the system inside and out, I would seemingly ask the weirdest questions. I actually go out of my way to figure out the most odd way to ask a question. It will serve many obvious purposes and one in particular that might not be. It will throw the person off and reset their though process. People will experience stereo type threat when talking to me about computers and are usually very frustrated by the time they finally call me. This makes the person needing help not able to think clearly and makes everything much more difficult. By throwing them off you can remove these barriers and make both parties breath easier.</p>
				<p>Asking good questions is kinda like giving good feedback. It has to be specific, answerable, and kind. There should be the least amount of details to be specific enough. This is difficult to perfect but it greatly increases your chance at a proper answer or a request for more information. Too much and people will ignore it. By answerable I am saying that there should be a simple answer to your question. If what you are asking is too complex, break it down to smaller “bite sized chunks” and then go step by step. Kind is just necessary in everything you do.</p>
