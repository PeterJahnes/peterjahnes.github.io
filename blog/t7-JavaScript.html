				<p>Lets jump right in to it, shall we?</p>
				<code>
					my_hash = {
						key1 => value1,
						key2 => value2,
						key3 => value3,
						key4 => value4,
						}

					var my_obj = {
						key1: value1,
						key2: value2,
						key3:  value3,
						key4: value4,
						}
				</code>
				<p>OK, so if you ask me they look the exact same lest the => vs : separating the key and value. For most applications of this type of data set, they have the exact same structure. We start to see the way they differ is when we go to access the keys and values. </p>
				<code>
					my_hash[key1]
					returns value1

					my_obj.key1
					returns value1
				</code>
				<p>Once again the 2 different calls look almost the same. So maybe it didn't start there... Where you do see the difference is when you start manipulating these with their respective language. It feels to me right now that ruby is much more powerful and easier to implement manipulating these object/hashes. When trying to use spiffy method ideas that I have learned to use in ruby, what takes a single word method call can take like 3 to 5 lines of code in javascript. Now that I have learned a bit about the 2 languages, I am quite surprised at just how different the process of getting things accomplished in these to languages is. Happy coding!</p>
